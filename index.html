                        <p>This is a dinner menu I created using react. It was one of the first things i made using a data driven <br>
                            menu page using react. It was a simple project to get started with react and data driven coding.

                        <p>The project above is an Exercise menu screen that is a  part of a basic app that constist of different <br>
                        components like a stopwatch that allows you to start/stop and reset it. it was a bit tricky to implement the <br>
                    stopwatch and get it to work efficiently but it worked out in the end.  </p>

                            adding new task to do. This was my first React Native project so it was a bit tricky dowloading all the <br>

                        <p>This project is a modified version of a previous one shown. This one was built used React Native Elements<br>
                        like FlatLists buttons and using Navigation Stack. This one is demonstrating a repetition component which lets<br>
